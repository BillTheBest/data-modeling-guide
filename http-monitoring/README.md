# HTTP Request / Response Data Models

Here's the data model used by [Pingpong](https://github.com/keenlabs/pingpong.git). Pingpong
makes requests to configured URLs and records request and response information in a single event.

A quick synopsis by section:

+ Environment â€“ Information about where the check is being sent from. Useful if you're testing latency from different parts of the world.
+ Request - Information about the request including how long it took and when it started
+ Check - Metadata about the check itself including its name, url, and any custom properies used for slicing and dicing
+ Response - Information about the response including status, response headers and optionally the [response body](https://github.com/keenlabs/pingpong#save-a-urls-json-response-body) if it was JSON
